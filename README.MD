# Main section
This is an Intel 4040 emulator written in C.

Please be aware that this emulator is in its beginning of development and not many features are emulated.

There are only a few working CPU instructions right now.

**DO NOT USE** this emulator as a documentation source for this processor!!!

# Compilation and running
The IDE used for compiling and running this emulator is CodeLite with TDM-GCC-64 (GCC 5.1) compiler.

# Info
Official CPU documentation used for development of this emulator is located [here](http://datasheets.chipdb.org/Intel/MCS-40/4040.pdf).

I am also using source code of Intel 4004 emulator located in [this Github repository](https://github.com/grubermeister/i4004), as a documentation for opcodes that are compatible with both processors.
